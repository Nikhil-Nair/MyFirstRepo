Learn Python basics using the famous "google python class":

https://developers.google.com/edu/python/

Cover all sections from "Overview" to "Utilities".

Time: 2 days should be enough.
--------------------------------------------------------

If you find the above resource to be a bit too concise, you can
work out all the chapters in Part-1 of this basic text:

https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc

(This  book uses Python 3; you can get Python3 on your machine simply
by typing "python3" instead of  "python". Please try out the code samples
on Python 2 also).

Time: 3 days should be enough.
--------------------------------------------------------

You can do either of the above. You need to properly learn about: basic data types(int/real,
list,tuple,string,dict,set), control structures and looping (if/while/for),
functions, list comprehensions. 

No need to get into classes/object oriented programming at
the moment; you can do it later.

There are two versions of Python - 2 and 3. If the book you are doing is based
on Python2, make sure you try out code samples in Python3 also - and vice versa.

---------------------------------------------------------


Note:

a) Some students had started working out a book called "think python" some time back. 
They can stop that for the moment and focus on the tasks I assign.

b) When working out text-books, please put up all the sample code/exercise solutions
in a git repo, properly organized by individual chapter (or section, whatever).

c) Do NOT put up exercise solutions of the MOOC's you are doing on github; making
solutions publically visible is against course rules. A suggestion is to create 
an account on:

https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/

I haven't used it personally, but they are fast  becoming a competitor for github.
I believe gitlab lets you create  "private" repositories. You can put  up MOOC
exercise solutions (for the moment, the Python MOOC on NPTEL online) in a private
repo on gitlab.

It is *highly* recommended that you try it out. Please post on the group if
you succeed in creating private repo's on gitlab. 

d) You have to do the current task + Python and Linux MOOC's in parallel. 

e) There are some other good books for Python:

http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html

http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html  

For this task, you are supposed to work out either the "google python class"
or Part-1 of the "automate the boring stuff with  python" book - but you can
very well refer (d) and (e) and of course make  use of any other resources 
out there on the Net!
