a) Join this course on EdX:

https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-0

It is a very basic course - you can take a few weeks to complete it - just
spend a small amount of time every day.

b) Doing the Python/Algorithms MOOC on NPTEL:

https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc16_cs11/announcements

Please keep up with the schedule ... submit assignments on time.

If you do the course well, you may think of writing the final 
exam (a small amount has to be paid) to get a certificate (writing the
paid exam is entirely optional...)

c) Download:

http://pramode.net/downloads/shellbasics.tgz

Untar and it and read  the two pdf files - work out all the sample
commands given in the document on your system. Experiment as much as
you can.

Time: 2 days.
